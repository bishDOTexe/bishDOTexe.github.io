Hello World/Blog!

Being my first post, a bit of an introduction is in order.
My name is Sam (bishDOTexe) and I am currently a Network Engineer based in the United States. However, my career interest has swiftly transitioned to Offensive IT Security.
Last year I obtained the C|EH and a foundational AWS certification in order to pursue a career transition to penetration testing. Currently, 
I am studying for the PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester) certification by [TCM Security]. This blog is a collection of my practical studies, 
research, script/tool creation, etc. Feel free to follow me along the way! 

Here are my socials: [Github], [Twitter], [Medium].
